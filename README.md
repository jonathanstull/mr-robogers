_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* _Any known issues_
* _should go here_

## Specs

* Create an application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user input with the following exceptions **in this order of operations**:
* Numbers that contain 3: Replace all digits with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* Numbers that contain 2: Replace all digits with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain 1: Replace all digits with "Beep!"
* Include functionality that refreshes the form so that the user can input a number again _ad infinitum_
* Example: a user inputs the number 45
  * The application should return a list of values as a string or an array
  * The values should correspond with: 0, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my neighbor?, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ... 40, Beep!, Boop!, Won't you be my neighbor, 44, 45


## Tests

Describe: robogerize(int);
  1. Test: "It returns an empty string when there is no input"
  Code:
  const input = [];
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: "";

  2. Test: "It returns an empty array when there is no input"
  Code:
  const input = [];
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: [];

  3. Test: "It returns an array with the number 0 when the input is 0"
  Code:
  const input = [0];
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: [0]

  4. Test: "It returns an array with the number 0 and 1 when the input is 1"
  Code:
  const input = [1];
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: [0, 1]

  5. Test: "It returns NaN when the input is NaN"
  Code:
  let input = ["NaN"]
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: NaN

  6. Test: "It returns array [0, 1, 2] when the input is the string 2"
  Code:
  let input = 2;
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: [0, 1, 2]

  7. Test: "It returns an array that counts to zero from any integer input"
  Code:
  createArray(int);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, ... , int - 1, int]

  8. Test: "It returns converts the number 3 to 'Won't you be my neighbor?'"
  Code:
  convertArray(array);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, 1, 2, "Won't you be my neighbor?", ... , 13, ... , int - 1, int]

  9. Test: "It converts any number containing 3 to 'Won't you be my neighbor?'"
  Code:
  convertArray(array);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, 1, 2, "Won't you be my neighbor?", ... , 12, "Won't you be my neighbor?", 14, ... , int - 1, int]

  10. Test: "It converts any number containing 2 to 'Boop!'"
  Code:
  convertArray(array);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, 1, "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", ... , 12, "Won't you be my neighbor?", 14, ... , int - 1, int]

  11. Test: "It returns an array that converts any number containing 1 to 'Beep!'"
  Code:
  convertArray(array);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", ... , "Beep!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!", ... , int - 1, int]

  12. Test: "It calls createArray and convertArray and returns array with Mr. Robogers' language"
  Code:
  robogerize(int);
  Expected Output: (int) [0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", ... , "Beep!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", "Beep!", ... , int - 1, int]

  13. Test: "It calls robogerize and returns a string with converted numbers"
  Code:
  robogerize(int);
  Expected Output: "0, Beep! Boop! Won't you be my neighbor? ... Beep! Won't you be my neighbor? Beep! ... , int - 1, int"

  14. Test: "It displays Mr. Robogers' language on a webpage"
  Code:
  robogerize(int);
  Expected Output: "0, Beep! Boop! Won't you be my neighbor? ... Beep! Won't you be my neighbor? Beep! ... , int - 1, int"
